 **Reflection :** Learning to assemble a PC has been one of the most interesting lessons for me. It provided a deeper understanding of the PC structure and taught me how to assemble a computer on my own. It also gave students the opportunity to learn about computer hardware, which is essential for computer science students. The entire process was quite enjoyable and improved my communication skills when assembling with others. Additionally, it fostered creativity and problem-solving abilities.💯💯
